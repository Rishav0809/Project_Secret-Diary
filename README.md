# Project_Secret-Diary
This is a diary created using HTML, CSS and Javascript for the FrontEnd part and PHP and MySQL for the backend part. It also has a login system wherein user can register into the portal and then manage thier secret dairy. I have used CKEditor as the text area wherein users can enter their data.
